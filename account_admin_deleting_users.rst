Deleting user accounts
==================================

Automatic deletion of never-validated accounts
-----------------------------------------------
Accounts that were created by users who never validated their account via email are automatically deleted after 21 days.

-----------------------------------------------
Deactivating user accounts

When users accounts are no longer needed due to employees leaving a company, we do not delete the account. Instead, the account is deactivated. 

Use the People function to Edit the user account, change the Status from Active to Blocked, scroll to the bottom and click Save.
Remember to remove the employee from Mailchimp.
