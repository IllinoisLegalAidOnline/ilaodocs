Deleting user accounts
==================================

Automatic deletion of never-validated accounts
-----------------------------------------------
Accounts that were created by users who never validated their account via email are automatically deleted after 21 days.

When users accounts are no longer needed due to employees leaving a company, we do not delete the account. Instead, the account is deactivated.
