SMS OTIS Confirmations & Reminders
===================================

SMS is integrated with our Online Triage & Intake System (OTIS) in three ways when a user has opted-in to receive OTIS-related messages:

* when a user completes an online intake, the receive their confirmation message in both email and SMS
* when a user completes an online intake where they schedule an appointment with a program, they receive reminders
* users receive follow-up system surveys that are targeted to get legal help users.

Confirmation messages
======================

Users who opt-in to SMS receive an immediate SMS confirmation message.  The message is pulled from each program's intake settings.  If the user applied and selected call back times, those are also listed.

Reminders
==========
The system will automatically send appointment reminders when:

* the user scheduled one or more times for the program to call them
* the user has opted-in to SMS through online intake

Reminders are sent:

* 24 hours before the first callback time
* 1 hour before the first callback time

.. note:: Example: User A schedules a callback for Wednesday, September 13 at 1:00pm or Thursday, September 14 at 9:--am.

          The user will get a 24 hour reminder at 1:00pm on September 12 and a 1 hour reminder at 12:00pm on September 12



Follow-up surveys
==================      

Follow up surveys may be sent using the `SMS Surveys <sms_surveys.html>`_ platform.  Surveys are sent to OTIS users when:

* the primary user type for the survey is "Get used legal help"
* the user meets the "send on conditions" for the survey
* the user has opted in for SMS through online intake
