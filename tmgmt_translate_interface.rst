Translating interface components

What is Interface Translation?
===============================

Interface includes pretty much everything that is not content (of any type) and includes:

* Blocks
* Menus
* Taxonomy terms
* System interface (including translatable strings contained in code)
* Views
* Custom code (including strings in custom modules and our theme

How is it Translated?
======================

Interface text can be translated in a few different ways:

* By translating directly in the translate page under Configuration/ Translate Interface/ Translate (https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/admin/config/regional/translate/translate)
* For blocks, menus, and taxonomy terms, by translating in-line
* By exporting or extracting strings to a PO file, translating offline and re-importing 


Through the UI
--------------

Go to Configuration and then `Translate interface<https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/admin/config/regional/translate/extract>`_.

Then click on the translate tab:

You can filter on language, whether the string has already been translated, and text groups.

Filtering on the string is *case sensitive.*  Please, please, PLEASE are all considered different words.
