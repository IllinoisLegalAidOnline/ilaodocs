====================
SMS Content Sharing
====================

The SMS icon is added to legal content's share bar when the legal content is not excluded from SMS.

Anonymous users
=================
Anonymous users are prompted to log in or register to share content via SMS.  They can also share it natively if they are on their mobile device and select the operating system.

Selecting "Android" or "iOS" will launch a link that opens the native SMS client and pastes the URL into it.
