Toolbox selector form
=========================

The toolbox selector form is a special portal component.  It should *only* be used in conjunction with a portal page of type "toolbox selector page."

Adding a toolbox selector form allows you to provide a title to the form within a portal to let users select which toolboxes they want to work with.

This will create a block that consists of the title and a Start button.  As toolboxes are added to the portal, checkboxes for each toolbox will appear.
