Lawyer Manuals
======================

Lawyer manuals leverage Drupal's book module to create a product that includes a manual home page, associated child pages (down to [x] levels), and a table of contents

Lawyer manuals require:

* Title
* Meta description for use in metatags, search engines, and social media
* Content description for use on the website
* One or more content blocks.  The content blocks currently supported in lawyer manuals are:

  * Text
  * Video
  * File (non-form)
  * Link (non-form)

* Legal position
* Content level, which defaults to "advanced"
* Primary legal category: which of the 9 top categories should this be added to.* Image for social media
* Restrictions.  Lawyer manuals by default are not restricted but may be limited to legal aid and/or pro bono members.
* The lawyer manual the page belongs to. 

.. note:: For new manuals, select "Create new" in the ADRM field

* Weight, for ordering pages in the book
* Annual updates: if the page needs to be updated based on an annual update, select it here.
* Exclude from search.  If the page needs to be removed from search, mark it here.
