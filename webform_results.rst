Webform results
=====================

All webforms have a standard set of results.

Clicking on the Results tab will show a table of all the submissions. From here, you can view each individual submission.

The "table" view shows all the values of each form and the "download" tab allows you to download the results in a CSV.

   Sample table of results

The webform results only ever includes results from the webform itself.  For anything that ties into other data sets, we will need to either:

* Create a custom report in the website.  For example, we've done this with the `OTIS triage user feedback survey results <https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/admin/reporting/sms-survey-results>`_, which uses a webform but also ties back to specific triage users. *This option requires developers to complete.*

* Download the webform report and the other data set (such as the people table) and use a tool like Excel or Google Fusion to tie the results together.
