Site FAQs
======================

The Site FAQs is a content type we use to provide a library of questions about ILAO's services and products.  The Site FAQs should be:

 * written for end users
 * be written in plain language
 * be platform neutral (should be correct for mobile, tablet, and desktop users) * relevant to the user (FAQs that relate to restricted functions should be restricted to users with those roles)
 * ordered in a meaningful way

The Site FAQ content type has the following fields:
 * Title - this should be the question 
 * Answer - this is a WYSIWYG field to answer the question.  Screenshots may be added as needed.
 * Category - the Site FAQ category to which the FAQ belongs.  This controls where the FAQ is displayed.  For example, questions under "Get Legal Help" will show on the sidebar in Get Legal Help.
 * Row weight - this is used to sort FAQs.  Lower numbered FAQs appear above higher numbered FAQs

.. note: FAQs without a row weight  will float higher than those with a row weight as empty is treated as "lower" than with a value.  For FAQ taxonomy terms where order is important, we need to add row weights to each question.
