Each portal grid should contains:

* a title.  This appears in the Grid's tab
* 4 Portal grid columns.  It is currently not designed to support anything but exactly 4 columns.

Each portal grid column contains:

* Title, for example "Gun violence" in the included images.
* Image
* Quote, for example "My cousin's death won't be for nothing - Dantae"
* Summary, for example, "Cousins and roommates, Dantae and Derrick, were involved in a shooting. Derrick was killed; Dantae was seriously injured. Dantae struggled with physical recovery and dealing with the police. The shooting also had a major impact on his family. They struggled to pay for healthcare and housing costs, until they got help."
* Button title and link.  For example, "Learn more" and /node/5
