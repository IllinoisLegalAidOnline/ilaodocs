Online intake survey
---------------------

The online intake survey is sent out:

* opted in to SMS via OTIS
* 7 days after the user has had their application eTransferred to an organization

There is a `report available <https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/admin/reporting/sms-survey-results>`_ to ILAO staff that ties together triage user data and survey results. 


User feedback survey

The user feedback survey is sent out:

* to registered users
* who are not advocate users
* 30 days after their last login

The system will retry the survey every 31 days up to 3 times.  

There is no report available beyond the `standard webform results <https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/119266/webform-results>`_ page.
