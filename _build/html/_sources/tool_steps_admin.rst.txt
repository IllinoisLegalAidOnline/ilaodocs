Tool Step Content Type
==========================

The tool step is the most granular page in the Toolbox framework.  Tool steps are either:

* a discrete step in the process
* a decision point

Each tool step must have:
* A title
* A yes/no as to whether the step is always required.  If the step is not always required, you can add text that will display indicating when the step is/is not required.
* Step type.  This is one of:

  * Webform
  * Single form information
  * Multiple form information
  * Text

* An indication if this is the last step in the process.
* Whether to include a Learn more component on the page.

Each tool may have:
  * Key terms
  * Short answer component
  * Yes/No webform component
  * Contact follow up component
