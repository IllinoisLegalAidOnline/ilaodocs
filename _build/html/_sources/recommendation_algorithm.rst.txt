Data Sources
--------------
To create the recommended for you blocks on the website with updated data we must update the underlying data sources used by the algorithm.

Website "Scrappers"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Scrape the existing website to create the scraper CSV files

Google analytics data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**GA landing page path duration all time**

This file must be named ga_landing_page_path_duration_all_time.csv.  The file should be added to the data_for_sql folder in the data folder where the recommender code is.

 This CSV should include:
     * landingpagepath (for example, /legal-information/getting-divorce
     * pagepath (for example, /legal-information/getting-divorce
     * secondpagepath:
       * (not set) if empty
       * pagepath if set
     * previouspagepath:
       * (entrance) if empty (in original data it was always entrance)
     * sessions - number of sessions in the report
     * avgsessionduration - a float value representing the average session duration
     * start_date, The startdate of the report, Formatted as mm/dd/yy.
     * end_date.  The end date of the report.  Formatted as mm/dd/yy.

**GA page path duration all time**
This file must be named ga_page_path_duration_all_time.csv.  The file goes in the data/data_for_sql folder.

The CSV must include:
 * pagepath (for example, /legal-information/getting-divorce)
 * sessions; integer representing the number of sessions the page was visited during the report span
 * avgsessionduration: float representing the average session duration during the report span
 * start_date: the start date of the report formatted as mm/dd/yy.
 * end_date: the end date of the report formatted as mm/dd/yyy.
