SMS Opt-ins
====================

Users can opt-in to SMS from ILAO in two ways:

* as a registered user, they can opt-in via the registration form.  
* an any user, they can opt-in to receive OTIS-related text messages. 

   
User registration form
-----------------------
Users are asked to opt-in or opt-out of text messages when the register.  They are then required to provide their mobile number.

If a user texts "Stop" to ILAO's number, the website updates their opt-in to an opt-out in addition to Twilio blocking messages from our number.
   

OTIS address form
-------------------
When a user completes online intake, they fill out a contact form. If the user is logged in and has provided a mobile number, it is pre-filled.

If they indicate that the phone number is a mobile number, they are required to opt in or out of OTIS-related text messages.
