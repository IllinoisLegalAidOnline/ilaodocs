==========================
Best bets (best matches)
==========================

Content managers can promote certain pieces of content as a "best bet" or "best match" in the CMS for one or more specific keywords.  

For example, if I add e-filing as a best bet term for the E-filing Basics article, that article will float to the top for searches for e-filing (but not for e-filing example or e-file my forms or other queries)

To add a query as a best bet for an article, edit the article and at the bottom is a field to add the best bet:

.. image:: assets/search-best-bet-form.png

If content managers attempt to tag more than one item to a search term, a validation error is thrown.  

The following content types can be used as "Best bets":

* Legal content
* Toolboxes
* Portal main pages
