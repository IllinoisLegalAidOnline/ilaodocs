==========================
Best bets (best matches)
==========================

Content managers can promote certain pieces of content as a "best bet" or "best match" in the CMS for one or more specific keywords.  For example, I can promote the victims of crime portal as a best bet for "crime victim," which would cause it to float to the top of search results.

If content managers attempt to tag more than one item to a search term, a validation error is thrown.  

Best bets can be set for the following content types:

* Legal content
* Toolboxes
* Portal main pages

A report of `all best bets <https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/admin/reporting/best-bets>`_ can be found in our reports.
