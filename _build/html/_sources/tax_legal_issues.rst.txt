Legal Issues Taxonomy
======================

The legal issue taxonomy is used to:
 * Tag legal content, ADRM, portal pages to substantive terms
 * Tag triage rules and referral services to the legal topics that the programs handle
 * Provide a front-end user interface for classifying user's legal issues for Get Legal Help
 * Provide two custom use cases for About Lawyers and Practice Resources

Structure
------------
.. image: assets/legal-issues-taxonomy.png

The taxonomy has 11 top level headings.  9 of these are used in the main site navigation:
 * Court & Hearings
 * Family & Safety
 * House & Apartment
 * Money & Debt
 * Business & Work
 * School & Education
 * Citizens & Immigration
 * Health & Benefits
 * Crime & Traffic

The remaining 2 are special use cases:  About Lawyers and Practice Resources.

About Lawyers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
About Lawyers is a special legal issue taxonomy term that is used exclusively to populate an About Lawyers block on the Get Legal Help pages.

Practice Resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This taxonomy term was added to allow us to create the practice resources page.  Some of the topics (professional responisbility, working with clients, lawyering skills) are substantive. Other terms are designed to "hold" specific types of information:
* Forms that are restricted to lawyers (Forms for Lawyers)
* IICLE smartbooks
* MCLE onDemand (video content that has MCLE available)  

.. warning: We will redo the practice resources section in fall 2018 and the specific types of information will be removed from the taxonomy and additional data points will allow us to capture that information.
