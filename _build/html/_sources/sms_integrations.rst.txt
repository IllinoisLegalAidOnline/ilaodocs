ILAO integrated SMS services via Twilio in several different ways on the website.  These include the ability to:

* respond to specific keywords, as part of structured campaigns
* send out Webform-based surveys to users
* allow registered users to receive notifications when content changes
* send confirmations when users complete online intake
* send reminders when users have scheduled appointments via OTIS
* allow registered users to text themselves legal content
