Webforms as blocks
===========================

To use a webform on a node (such as within a toolbox or portal content), on the webform tab:

* Click on Form settings
* Click on advanced settings
* Check "Available as block"

This will cause the webform to show in the portal webform paragraph bundle so that it can be added to content.t
