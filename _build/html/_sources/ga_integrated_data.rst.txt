Google Analytics Data In Website
===================================
We pull in two metrics into the legal content content type on a regular basis:

* Popular views which pulls in the number of page views for a node in the last 2 days.  This was going to be used for Popular today but it would likely never change and was not implemented.

* Longer-term page views which pulls in the number of page views for a node over the last 60 days.  This metric is used to determine what shows up on the legal information subcategory pages, form library block, related forms block, related articles block as it is the primary sort for those views, showing the more popular items first.
