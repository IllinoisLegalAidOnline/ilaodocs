More like this blocks
================================

The "more like this" feature in Drupal's solr configuration allows us to add related blocks to various content types.  We have more like this blocks on:

* Attorney manuals, to highlight legal content to encourage non-attorneys to go to simpler content
* Blog posts that are legal in nature, to highlight related legal content to get blog post readers to additional resources

More like this blocks use the body of the node to generate similar results. In both of our blocks, the system looks at:

* title
* legal issues

and will filter so that it is restricted to the following:

* legal content
* toolboxes
* tools
