Legal Server Problem Code Mappings
===================================
The `Legal Server problem code mappings taxonomy <https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/admin/structure/taxonomy_manager/voc/legal_server_problem_code_mappings>`_ maps ILAO's legal issue taxonomy to problem codes in Legal Server to support eTransfers.

The taxonomy is made up of the `Legal problem codes defined by Legal Server <https://iloi.legalserver.org/static/external_xml_intake/lookup.xsd>`_ for use in eTransfers. It includes fields for:
* legal issues from our `Legal issues taxonomy <tax_legal_issues.html>`_
* LSC problem code 

.. Note:: For example, we've mapped our bankruptcy terms (Bankruptcy, a bankruptcy case currently in court, Filing for bankruptcy, Somone filing for bankrupcty who owes me money) to Legal Server code 01 Bankruptcy/ Debtor Relief.  When a user selects one of these in Get Legal Help and completes online intake, it shows up in Legal Server under the 01 Bankruptcy code.
