Annual Updates Taxonomy
==============================
The `annual updates taxonomy <https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/admin/structure/taxonomy_manager/voc/annual_updates>`_ contains the names and dates for when we need to update content for specific reasons.

In addition to a name, a date is associated with the term. The date supports recurrence so that we can track events that happen every week, month, quarter, year.  

.. warning:: If it is 2035, the annual updates are expiring and need to be reviewed.

The list appears on legal content and if checked, will send an email to users with the content manager role 30 days before the date associated with the term.
